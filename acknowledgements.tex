It should not come as a surprise that the years during a PhD are the most intense during one's life.
Many crossed my path during these years and contributed in shaping this experience.
I thank you all for what you gave me: I hope I was able to gift you at least a spark of inspiration.

Thanks to Michele...

A big thank to the REVEALers, in particular its \emph{hard core} members: Andrea, Luca, and Roberto, who shared with me the journey from the beginning.
I loved you. And I hated you. Often both at the same time.


Thanks to the Pharo community

Thanks to the people in charge of making badges at the conferences I attended.
I have rarely seen matched the creativity that you constantly put in finding new ways of writing my name.
I have to admit it: ``Sasso, Tommaso Dal'' is a masterpiece.
