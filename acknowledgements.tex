It should not come as a surprise that the years during a PhD are the most intense during one's life.
For me, the world changed---several times.
I learned passion, and I learned frustration.
I learned anger, which in turn lead me to better understand peace.
But most of all, I became a father, which to date is the quietest, yet most astonishing change that I have experienced in my man's life.

Many crossed my path during these years and contributed in shaping this experience.
I thank you all for what you gave me: I hope I was able to gift you at least a spark of inspiration.

Thanks to Michele, advisor and friend.
I know I have been an unconventional PhD student, if anything because no PhD student is a conventional one.
Nonetheless, you had the patience to wait for me during weird times ---OK, maybe not crazy-Rumanian weird---, with your stern kindness that bewitches bachelor students and amuses secretaries.
Yours was an example that left a mark in me.
I am no Mike Ross, but I still I hope that my passage left a trace of some kind in the REVEAL family.

Speaking of which, a big thank goes to the REVEALers, in particular its \emph{hard core} members: Andrea, Luca, and Roberto, who shared with me the journey from the beginning.
I loved you. And I hated you. Often both at the same time.
Roberto, thank you for...
Luca, thank you for...
Andrea, thank you for...

Thanks for the Dean's office, for accepting my madness and backing it up with even more madness.
And for the chocolate, too.

Thanks to the Pharo community...

Thanks to my ghostwriter Alberto (S)Bacchelli...

Thanks to my family...

Finally, a special mention goes to the people in charge of making badges at conferences: Rarely I have seen matched the creativity that you put in writing my name.
Let's face it: ``Sasso, Tommaso Dal'' is a masterpiece.
